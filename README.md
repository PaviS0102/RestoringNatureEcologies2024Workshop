# RestoringNatureEcologies2024Workshop
This repository contains the script, resources, and slides for a workshop on 'Use of tech in restoration landscapes' at the Restoring Nature Ecologies conference hosted by the Ecological Restoration Alliance (ERA) from 27th to 29th November 2024.

**Details:**

In this workshop, I will provide a brief introduction to acoustic technology and will present a study that uses such passive acoustic monitoring data to understand the impacts of restoration through the removal of the invasive shrub, _Lantana camara_, on the vocal behaviour of red-vented bulbuls in a tropical dry forest in central India.
